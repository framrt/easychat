# EASYCHAT

This is a easy way to communicate in local using socket. 

The final goal is to create a windows using just C and a communication channel using a home PC as destination server. 

Compile instruction: 

gcc tcpServer.c -o server

gcc tcpClient.c -o client 

to exit from the chat type "Exit" 

developed in nvim just using gcc as compiler 


firstly execute the server ./server command, then type 
./client, so the communication has been established.
